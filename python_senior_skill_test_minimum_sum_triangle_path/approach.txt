defining the function MinimumSumPathTriangle which take triangle list as parameter:
	iterating over for loop desecendingly as the length:
		iterating over for loop ascendingly as the index over length of the specific row:
			modifiying the element value with sum of the current value and minimum of the index value and index+1 value 
	print the modified triangle for reference
	return the first value of the modified triangle

define the triangle
print MinimumSumPathTriangle(triangle)
