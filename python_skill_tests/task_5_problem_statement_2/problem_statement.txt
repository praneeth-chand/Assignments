Given a string ‘str’ of digits, find the length of the longest substring of ‘str’, such that the length of the substring is 2k digits and sum of left k digits is equal to the sum of right k digits.

For e.g.:
Input: str = "123123"
Output: 6
The complete string is of even length and sum of first and second
half digits are same

Input: str = "1538023"
Output: 4
The longest substring with same first and second half sum is "5380"
